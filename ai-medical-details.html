                  I coordinated the improvement of the product 
                  with both the internal team and hospital staff, 20+ people in total.
                  Regardless of the physical limits due to the Covid-19, I conducted 
                  a UX research and facilitated the new release in 4 weeks.       
                  The nurses found the latest version much more suitable for 
                  their professional documentation needs.

                    Our company's AI medical transcription software has been introduced 
                    in some Taiwanese hospitals. The software was embeded in their hospital 
                    information system, as an alternative for medical documentation.
                    <ins>One hospital adopted the new tool for half a year, but I found their usage
                    gradually decreased after the one-month trial.</ins><BR><BR>
            
                    The nurses complained that speech recognition was not 
                      faster than typing and clicking. <ins>Our team investigated the recognition rate,  
                      but it reached 90%, which met our standard. To find out the root cause and 
                      improved the product, I organized a remote UX research to clarify the problem.

                    <ins>By interviewing the nurses remotely, I found 
                    it took nurses 20 minutes to finish the admission records for the first-time patients, 
                      which was three times longer than chronic patients.
                    </ins> First-time patients had to fill in their background information, allergy, and medical history - 
                    which included 100+ questions. Nurses usually stayed nearby the bed, 
                    asking questions and writing it down on a paper. After that, nurses had to 
                    key in all the answers in the system when they went back to the nursing station. 
                    If they got busy, the e-documentation would be delayed. 
                    AI medical transcription allows nurses to fill in the form by speech recognition.
                    
                   <ins>Both the nursing director and I agreed that the documentation for the first-time patients 
                    can bring significant improvement, and it turned out to be our target scenario.</ins>

                <p class="mb-30">
                  Limited by the Covid 19, I made a quick plan for remote troubleshooting - 
                  2 days collecting bug logs and screen recording from the hospital system, 
                  1 day video analysis, and 2 days voice recognition bug analysis.
                  Only the videos were offered by nurses, while the other data was 
                  retreieved from our backend site. <ins>With limited time, I negotiated with our
                  technical PM with the task details, my expectation and timeline</ins>, so the speech-to-text(STT) 
                  correctness can be calculated in time. 
                                
                </p>

                <p class="mb-30">
                    Logs were quite messy with unrecognizable and repeated STT. <ins>I cleaned and sorted the data on Excel, 
                    observing the usage amount of each nursing unit, and the sentences that were incorrectly recognized.
                    I found that nurses had to speak 8 to 10 words for 1 question on average.</ins>
                    To finish a form, they may need to speak 800 to 1000 Chinese words, which was definitely a burden.
                    So I started to think about how nurses can speak fewer to fill in the same form.
                    
                </p>

                <p class="mb-30">
                   Additionally, <ins>I analyzed the videos from nurses by breaking their screen behaviors into actions, and visualized
                  them into a step-by-step process chart (below).</ins> The chart indicated that 
                  AI transcription involved multiple clicks, from activating the software, adding an entry, moving to next page, editing and deleting a record, 
                   nurses had to click on the button on our software, or moving it around so the form was not hidden by the front-end AI tool window.
                   <ins>Though the total clicks was not as many as typing, this result can neither convince nurses the efficiency of the new tool.</ins>

                  <ins>I brought up this main painpoint to the R&D team, encouraging any ideas to have
                   nurses fill in the admission note without reading each question aloud.</ins>

                  In solution brainstorming, <ins>I first collected possible solutions with our engineers and designers. 
                  Our proposal was to shorten the key sentences.</ins> For example, instead of saying 
                  <strong>"Blood pressure 120 over 60. Consciousness clear. Left hand and right hand, 
                    muscle power normal. Breathing rate normal."</strong>
                  , nurses can simply say <strong>"Blood pressure 120 over 60."</strong> 
                  The rest of the questions would be set as normal by default.
                  
                  Later <ins>I held an online meeting with hospital IT staff and nurses, 
                  introducing our proposal, and makinng sure the feasibility and the 
                  schedule of the updated version.</ins>

                After one month, we released the new version. 
                The nurses said the new design allowed them to speak naturally
                 with professional terms they frequently said. 
                What's more, since the normal vital sign can be checked automatically, 
                nurses saved lots of time and energy. They said, <ins>"most patients are partly ill,
                so reading every normal vital sign is not smarter than clicking. 
                " However, since we modified the languague pattern to be more flexible,
                nurses could pay more attention on describing the illness.</ins>
                Overall, the new version was a success and triggered the excitement for nurses 
                to give it a try.

                From this project, I know more about the workflow of nurse documentation. 
                Nurses care about efficiency, correctness, and simplicity. 
                <ins>In the previous version, our team focused on correctness, pursuing a higher recognition rate, 
                but simplicity was ignored.</ins> Medical transcription is different from the general STT technology used in 
                Siri or Google assistant. The medical STT model has to recognize the phrases commonly 
                used by nurses. <ins>If nurses are limited to follow certain linguistic rules, they will
                feel fatigued and give up this tool.</ins> <br><br>

                There are still things to be improved. For example, 
                To calculate the recognition correctness rate, it sometimes relies on someone 
                who is familiar with nursing forms, but I am the only expert in our team. To share my loading, 
                I created an instruction slide, so interns can help me with the job. 
                Furthermore, <ins>we didn't have a dashboard system that can generate usage data regularly. 
                If we had had one, we could have discovered the problem earlier. </ins>
