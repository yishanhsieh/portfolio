                      VGH is a first-class medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. 
                      An anesthesiologist takes care of 50 ~ 80 clinic patients for preanesthetic assessment in 3 hours on average, 
                      which means a doctor has to finish a checkup per patient in 2.5 minutes.
                      What’s more, since the preanesthetic assessment documentation hasn’t been digitalized, 
                      doctors have to quickly record as they speak to the patient, 
                      which led to patients’ dissatisfaction.
                      <ins>Due to the overloading patient numbers, 
                      each patient should wait for 40 minutes to 1 hour,
                      but take the assessment shortly, leading to patients’ 
                      complaints.</ins>

                      To investigate the current workflow in hospital,
                       I invited doctors who participated in this project
                        and our colleagues who have done the assessment
                         in this hospital.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       On doctors' side, I interviewed 8 anesthesiologists
                       to understand their current assessment flow and questions. 
                       After the interview, I visualized doctor’s assessment workflow chart.        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Task 3 (yellow block) is the routin assessment 
                      QA that doctors agreed that it can be asked first 
                      by the service robot.
                    </p>

                <p class="mb-30">
                  On patients' side, I interviewed staff in the hospital 
                  and two of my colleagues with preanesthetic assessment experience
                  to understand appointment flow and explore what different types of 
                  patients care about. I visualized their experiences into a user journey chart, 
                  and I found task 4 and task 5 (orange block) - medical history inquiry, 
                  which consisted of fixed questions with a certain sequence, were two 
                  steps where Zenbo could provide assistance.   
                </p>

                <p class="mb-30">
                  From user interviews, field observation, and collecting experience from hospital staff,
                  I summarized three types of patients according to their health status 
                  - (1) the middle-aged with potential cancer risk, 
                  (2) the middle-aged with controllable cancer and requires periodical checkups, 
                  (3) elderly with complex conditions. 
                  <ins>Since the robot’s dialogue engine was designed to 
                  recognize Chinese, we excluded patient type 3 out of our first target audience 
                  in this project.</ins>

              /> 
              <p>
                From the user research, I found that most patients preferred a more efficient and customized assessment.
                <ins>However, in the current assessment, doctors had to ask them the routine medical history questions 
                before giving a more detailed consultation, so how to help doctors focus on giving personalized investigation and suggestions
                in a short time becomes a key for improving the efficiency and patient experience.</ins> This also turns out to be an opportunity for Zenbo.

            <h3>
              Phase 1: Role & Function Design
            </h3>
            <p>
              In this project we used ASUS service robot, 
              Zenbo Junior, as the intervention. 
              Zenbo features its conversational engine, 
              so I proposed Zenbo could either play as a 
              doctor or an assistant; however, after discussing 
              with our hospital client, due to medical 
              legistration concerns, Zenbo should be an assistant 
              that doesn’t provide prescription.

              <ins>The main task of Zenbo is to ask the routine 
              12 medical history questions, and the human 
              doctors would focus on explaining anesthetic risks.</ins> 
              In terms of facial expression, since most of patients 
              are middle-age adults, I selected a friendly smily face, 
              and a professional female tone as the robot’s voice, as shown below.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Phase 2: Human-Robot Cooperation Flow
            </h3>
            <p>
              How to embed Zenbo in the current 
              assessment workflow is one of the challenging 
              part in this project. After user interviews, 
              I drew a storyboard to help our in-house teams 
              understand the clinic environment, 
              as shown in the below left hand picture.

              <ins>Considering Zenbo’s voice recognition quality 
              and patients’ privacy, I suggested placing Zenbo 
              in an individual room.</ins> After several times of negociation,
               the hospital staff and I designed a service flow
                that can make Zenbo’s room closer to the clinic,
                 as shown in the below right picture.
            </p>

            <img

              alt="reviews2"
            /> 
            <h3>Phase 3: Dialogue Flow Design</h3>
            <p>
              Based on the current assessment questionnaire, 
              I interviewed 8 anesthesiologists how they ask 
              patients their medical history, and finally summarized 
              the questions into a flow.
            </p>

            <img
            src="assets/img/portfolio/Zenbo-4.png"
            class = "img-responsive mb-30"
            alt="reviews2"
          /> 
          <p>
            <ins>To verify the user experience of the dialogue design at a low cost, 
            I invited four colleagues who have experienced pre-anesthesia checkups 
            in that hospital to join the Wizard of OZ test.</ins> I invited colleagues to 
            speed up our dailogue flow test and make adjustment quickly.
          </p>
          <img
            src="assets/img/portfolio/Zenbo-9.png"
            class = "img-responsive mb-30"
            alt="reviews2"
          />

          <p>
            From the pilot study, participants indicated that the robot 
            didn’t have follow-up questions, which seemed unnatural. 
            <ins>According to the feedback, I added ‘follow-up’ function on the dialogue flow. 
            Under this new structure, when a patient said he/she has diabetes, 
            the robot can jump to related follow-up questions.</ins>
            <br><br>
            The wizard of OZ test also helps strengthen the error handling mechanism - 
            if the robot cannot understand the patient’s answer, 
            it will ask again in another way, 
            but if the robot still cannot get the answer after three times, 
            the robot will leave the answer blank with a mark, 
            and this question will be asked by the human doctor.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-30">  
            The main purpose of the field study is to investigate 
            whether the robot-assisted assessment can improve patients’ satisfaction. 
            After reading <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15041606/">Hepner et al.’s study</a>, I designed a between-subject experiment. 
            The participants were randomly assigned into two groups - 
            the robot-assisted group or the control group. 
            The advantage of experiment is that it’s clear to provide insights 
            for hospital directors to compare before-after difference.
            <br><br>
            However, due to Covid-19, we didn’t achieve the expected 
            numbers of participants, which should be 30 people per group. 
            Only 27 patients were recruited in total. 16 participants were 
            interviewed by Zenbo and a real doctor, and 11 participants 
            were control group who were interviewed by the doctor.
            <br><br>
            After the experiment, I interviewed the robot-assisted group 
            about their interaction with the robot.

          <h3 class="mb-30">Descriptive Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            Since the number of participants hasn’t reached statistic significance, 
            I adopted descriptive analysis and explored more insights from user interviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            The robot-assisted group spent 2’56 minutes for assessment on average, 
            which was more than the control group by almost 1 minute. 
            This was caused by longer medical history interview by Zenbo, 
            which took almost 2 minutes. 
            Though the robot-assisted group got a bit lower average satisfaction 
            than the control group, the score is still high with 4.56 out of 5.
            <br><br>
            The result indicates a positive sign of using robot in the clinic. 
            <ins>Patients were served for longer time on personal medical history interview 
            with the robot, and still remained highly satisfied.</ins>

          <h3 class="mb-30">Qualitative Analysis</h3>

          <p>
            From the user interview, I summarized the following insights:

            <br><br>1. Patients are more willing to speak more with the robot.
            <blockquote>
              I talked more to Zenbo... <strong>because it is a robot, 
              I felt relaxed to share</strong> (my medical history). -(Female, aged 42, patient type 2).
            </blockquote>

            2. Doctors can ask more detailed based on Zenbo’s assessment.
            <blockquote>
              One patient has hyperthyroidism, and it was recorded by Zenbo, 
              so I can directly ask more detailed about 
              the patient’s current situation. -(Dr. Ke)
            </blockquote>

            3.Patients were concerned whether Zenbo understood their answer.
            <blockquote>
              In the question about smoking habit, I answered “No” for three times, 
              but the robot kept asking again. I was confused until it moved on to the next 
              question. <strong>I wonder whether he could understand or not.</strong> -(Male, Aged 57, patient type 1)
            </blockquote>
          </p>

            Reflections & Next step
          </h2>
          <p>
            From the result, both patients and doctors revealed positive 
            feedback to Zenbo’s assistance. <ins>I am also impressed that Zenbo’s 
            cuteness can ease patients’ uncertainty and make them willing to talk more.</ins> 
            However, this time we only recruited 27 participants, so it still requires 
            further investigation whether Zenbo brings effective help. <br><br>

            <ins>Zenbo’s voice recognition also caused users confusion 
            and disbelief when it cannot identify their words correctly. 
            The current error handling is to repeat the questions in different ways again, 
            but it also aroused patients’ impatience. </ins>
            As a result, next step, I will focus on the error-handling design for the missing answers.
