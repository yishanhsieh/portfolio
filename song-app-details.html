                    As an international student, I often start a small talk 
                    with popular animes like One Piece and Naruto, and popular 
                    Japanse anime music that has been viral around the world.
                    
                    <ins>This song-guessing game is designed for young people to have fun 
                    through anime songs and the guessing game.</ins> In this way, international students from Asia or generally students who love animes 
                    can get involved in the new environment more easily.

                  <p class="mb-30">
                    <ins>To understand how to design a song-guessing game, 
                    I searched the existing similar products, including SongPop Classic 
                    and SongTrivia, and concluded their UX flows into a chart.</ins> A guessing-song 
                    game can be a multiplayer or single game. SongPop provides different song types to choose from, 
                    but in our case I skipped this step because the defaut is Japanese anime songs. 
                    Each round has 5 to 10 questions, and there is a review/grading page in the end of the game.
                    After understanding the UX flow of a guessing-song game,
                    I started thinking about the game mechanics.

                    Most of guess-song games position themselves 
                    as competitive games. However, competitive play 
                    often leads players to guess impulsively, skipping 
                    correct answers and rushing through questions. 
                    <ins>I believe multiplayer competition might hinder the 
                    pleasure. That’s why 
                    I designed the game for individual play first.</ins>

                  <p class="mb-30">
                    In the existing games, players have only one 
                    chance to guess the song in every question. 
                    Regardless of the result, the game automatically 
                    moves on to the next question but <ins>the current design can hardly intrigue students 
                    because they were rushed to finish the quize, so in my design, users have to try and error
                    until they found the correct answer.</ins>

              <p class="mb-30">
                I developed a web app for prototyping by React Native, NodeJS, and Expo. 
                The music is from Spotify API, connecting to a Japanese anime playlists created by me. 
                To cut down the API cost, I hosted the music data on Google Firebase. 
                The final work is rendered on the <a href="https://guesssong-2fd90.web.app/">Live Demo website</a> (recommended to open on phone).

                User Testing
              </h2>

              <p class="mb-30">
                <ins>I randomly invited 6 university students at Indiana University Bloomington
                to play the game in a demo workshop.</ins> There were two groups of students,
                one had three American men, and the other had two Indian men who loved animes. 
                Both grous disucssed frequently as they played together. 
                There was a girl who learned Japanese playing the game alone, 
                and she discussed the anime with me excitedly during the game.
             </p>
              
             <figure>
              <img

              <figcaption class="mb-30">(*Illustrated by me, showing the user testing scenario)
              </figcaption>
             </figure>
 
              <p class="mb-30">
                Throughout the demo, I noticed some interesting points:
                <ul class="journal-list">
                  <li class="mb-30">
                    <strong>The game sparked a lot of group discussion.</strong><br>
                    <ins>Students playing the game in a group had the most discussion.</ins> 
                    Although the American guys were not a fan of Japanese animes and                     didn't understand Japanese, they listened to the music attentively, 
                    and trying to find the answer by the album picture.
                  </li>

                  <li class="mb-30">
                    <strong>Anime fans were more immersed in the game.</strong><br>
                    The students who have learned Japanese or have watched Japanese animes 
                    <ins>were excited and got surprised when they heard the music they were
                     familiar with.</ins> Comparatively, those who were less familiar with animes
                     <ins>focused on cracking the questions by trial and error. </ins>
                  </li>

                  <li class="mb-30">
                    <strong>Question limits needed for the quiz.</strong><br>
                    The students who were less familiar with animes 
                    felt distracted after five questions, and the anime fans can play 
                    more than seven questions. <ins>This indicated that five to ten questions per round
                    is an ideal number.</ins>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <h2 class="journal-section-title">
                Adjustment of the Design
              </h2><br>
              <p>From students' feedback and my observation, 
                I made two UI adjustments:</p>
              <ul class="journal-list">
                <li class="mb-30">
                  <strong>Enlarge the option panel.</strong><br>
                  Since the song title was acquired from the Spotify API, 
                  the maximum can be as long as 8 words, 
                  which required users to scroll down. 
                  However, <ins>most of users didn’t scroll
                  by dragging the scroll bar on the option panel. 
                  As a result, I minimized
                  the button ‘Random Song’ to an icon, leaving more space 
                  for showing options. </ins>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-30">
                  <strong>Showing anime introduction after each question.</strong><br>
                  The anime introduction were shown on the final result page 
                  in the first version, but <ins>most discussions happened during song-guessing.
                                   
                  Thus, I moved the anime introduction forward -  the introduction of the selected anime
                  was shown right after the question. This was a good timing to 
                  provide extra information</ins> since users would be much more curious about the anime.

                Reflection & Next Step
              </h3>
              <p class="mb-30">
                The app aims to help young students
                who are interested in Japanese animes do ice-breaking 
                in a new environment. <ins>The user testing approved the motivation  
                of making the game - Students got lots of interactions and had fun with others, 
                showing the product has its social value. </ins>
                However, it was harder for students who were less familiar with animes to 
                experience excitement, but they could still learn the anime introduction 
                regardless of whether they guessed it right or wrong.
  
              
                
                <br><br>
                The game is still in the early stage and requires more adjustments, 
                such as adding the multiplayer mode, and adding a time limit for each question.
                When developing and designing this app, I found it hard to make a balance between 
                users' suggestion and my motivation. For example, adding time restriction 
                makes the game a competition, which contradicts my expectation of the game -  
                be relaxing and learning animes. I actually haven't decided how to adjust 
                for the next version, but I know <ins>I have to clarify the persona of my target player,
                , the game's motivation, when the game will be played, etc. With more investigation about the TA, 
                it will be easier to make the decision.</ins>
